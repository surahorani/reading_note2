# functions

**Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it**

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

1.The name of the function.

2.A list of parameters to the function,enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

3.the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
